Reimplement hangman

Limitations/differences from before:

-No loops are allowed except for the main game loop, which
is a single while loop. All looping must be subsumed through
map, filter, and reduce.

-The art for hangman should be read from a file, this art represents
the state of the game.

-The user should be able to enter their name, where their name and
score will be recorded to a file after each game.

-The game will tell the user if they have the high score or not.

-No exceptions are allowed, all exceptions must be caught by the program.

Add unit testing to your project.
